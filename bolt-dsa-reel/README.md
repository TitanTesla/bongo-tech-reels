# 🛺 Bolt × DSA — Reel Studio

**A 60-second TikTok/Reels storyboard that teaches Data Structures & Algorithms through how Bolt finds you a ride in Dar es Salaam.**

`React` · `TypeScript` · `Vite` · `GSAP` · `Framer Motion` · `Tailwind CSS`

## 📌 Overview

Reel Studio maps every concept of a 60-second educational reel to a real, scripted motion animation. Each DSA concept is a **tab**; the voice-over **script sits off-canvas** and highlights line-by-line in sync with the animation. The canvas is a phone-safe area — it starts below the social-app top bar and ends above the caption/icons, so nothing important ever hides behind TikTok or Instagram UI.

**The story:** you tap *Tafuta Ride* at Mwenge, and two seconds later a bodaboda is on the way — graphs, spatial indexes, Dijkstra, and sorting did the work.

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 **Six scripted scenes** — Hook · Graph · Spatial index · Dijkstra · Sorting · Payoff, each a hand-built GSAP timeline
- 📱 **Phone-safe canvas** — 9:16 frame with TikTok/Reels chrome zones; pure-black, no gradients, no stock assets
- 📝 **Synced script panel** — Gen-Z Swahili/English VO lines highlight as the animation plays; click any line to seek
- 🛺 **Dar es Salaam world** — cars, bajaji, and bodaboda glyphs; TZS fares; Mwenge → Kariakoo route
- ⏯️ **Transport controls** — play/pause, restart, scrubbable progress bar for rehearsing VO timing

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# prerequisites: Node 20+

# install
npm install

# develop
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:5173

# ship
npm run build      # type-checks + bundles to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

## 🎬 How It Works

1. Every scene builds a **paused GSAP timeline** inside a `gsap.context` and hands it to the app shell.
2. The shell drives play/pause/seek and, on every tick, maps `timeline.time()` to the active script line.
3. All map scenes share one **city graph** (`data/city.ts`), so the reel feels like one continuous world instead of six clips.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Auto-advance: play all six scenes as one continuous 60-second take
- [ ] Record mode: fullscreen phone frame only, for clean screen capture
- [ ] Ep. 2 — `mixx-db-reel`: the database secrets behind Mixx by Yas transfers
